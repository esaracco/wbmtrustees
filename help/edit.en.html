</ul>
<li>
<p>Click on "Add" to add a new rule.
First of all, tou must select the group or the user concerned by this
rule. A rule may apply either to a group or to a user, but never to
both.<br />
Then, specify the rights by selecting the relevant checkboxes. You may
also specify, in addition to the rights, a "modifier".
For instance, you can explicitly forbid reading by specifying "D" in
before the "R" attribute.</p>
<p>The meaning of the attributes and modifiers is as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tr bgcolor="silver"><td><b>Attribute</b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>R</td><td>Reading files</td></tr>
<tr><td>W</td><td>Writing files and directories</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>Going through directories</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Reading directories</td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>File execution</td></tr>
<tr><td>U</td><td>Use Unix permissions</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="silver"><td colspan=2><b>Modifiers</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>Reinitialise persmissions (instead of defining them)</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>Deny (instead of allow)</td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>The attribute applies to all but the specified owner (group or user)</td></tr>
<tr><td>O</td><td>One level only. The attributes applies to the
specified directory and to the files it contains, but not to
sub-directories</td></tr>
</table>
