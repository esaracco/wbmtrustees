Click on "Add" to add a new path (directory or path) for which you
want to add specific rights.
You may either fill in the path manually, or select a path in the
server's filesystem by clicking on the "..." button located to the
left of the "Add" button. This will open a new window in which you
will be able to go through the filesystem tree. Then click on the "Ok"
button. The selected path will appear in the text field.
